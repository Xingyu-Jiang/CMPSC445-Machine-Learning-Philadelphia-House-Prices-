# CMPSC445 Machine Learning Proejct Philadelphia House Prices

## Data Collection

Students will gather data from various sources such as real estate websites, public databases, and APIs. The collected data will include information about the characteristics of houses such as location, size, and etc. (The number of train data needs to be more than 5000)

## Data Preprocessing

The collected data will undergo preprocessing to clean and prepare it for analysis. This may involve handling missing values, removing outliers, and converting categorical variables into a suitable format for modeling.

## Feature Engineering

Students will engineer new features from the existing data to improve the performance of the predictive model. This may include creating interaction terms, transforming variables, or extracting meaningful information from the available features.

## Model Development

Using the preprocessed and engineered data, students will develop machine learning models to predict house prices. They will experiment with different algorithms such as linear regression, decision trees, random forests, or gradient boosting, and select the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics.

## Construction of Test Dataset and Evaluation of Your Model (What data needs to be test data will be specified later. I probably ask you to construct most recent data for house sale as test data)

Students will construct a test dataset to evaluate the performance of their trained model. They will apply the model to the test dataset and assess its predictive accuracy using appropriate evaluation metrics such as mean absolute error or root mean squared error.

## Discussion on Your Project

In the final report, students will discuss their project findings, including insights gained from data analysis, challenges encountered during model development, and recommendations for improving the predictive performance of the model. They will also reflect on the strengths and limitations of their approach and propose future research directions.
